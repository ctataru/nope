# Nope.

A dumb webapp to creatively say "Nope." to your friends.

Head to the homepage [here](https://www.nope.live) to create your "nope". Once you land on the display page,
you can copy the URL and send it to the concerned friend.

Currently supported languages:
- English (en)
- French (fr)

As of right now, you'll only be able to change languages by setting the `?l=` query string to the desired language's code.
